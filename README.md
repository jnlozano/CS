PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: 

The main file worked on here was Gui2048.java. The other two files, Board.java and Constants2048.java were givens. Though the board file was an updated version of my psa3 file. Anyways, the file Gui2048 handles the user interface of the game. Basically, the pretty colors and shapes to make the game more appealing to play. Without going into the specifics, there are certain methods implemented in the file to make squares for the tiles with printed numbers on each tile. The same goes for all the text and colors that are displayed during the games playthroughs. It was pretty hard to test this file since my board.java file was pretty bad...I got a low score on it since it didn't work that well. Therefore I had to work a bit on the Board.java file first before touching the majority of my interface. Still, I was able to see the majority of the functions work by changing Board.java in different ways. 

SHORT RESPONSE:

-UNIX/LINUX-
1. mkdir -p fooDir/barDir
2. ls *.java will look for all of the files in the directory that are java files.  
3. use the line vim *.java. This *.java generally works for everything such as compiling all of the files.

-JAVA-
4. Static means that the method can be called without an instance of a class. So a method named "static" could be called as static(). It does not need anything before it. 
5. She can make all of the shapes and/or colors different classes that extend from a main shap class. This would be similar to our psa about shapes and drawing. It'd be more organized and easier to call upon in different files that don't need to rely on the shapes.
